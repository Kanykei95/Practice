	Class and Objects:
	-->Class is a blueprint which we can create multiple objects from one blueprint.
	-->Class simply declares all the types of data/information and behaviors/methods that one object should have.
	--> One class has 2 things:
		1.Data/Information
		2.Behavior/method

	Ex.

		class dog{
			String breed
			int age;
			String gender;
			String color;

			public void (){
			System.out.println("Dog is barking");

			}
		}
